                <h4>Pizza
                </h4>
                <p class="discription">
                    The modern pizza was originally invented in Naples, Italy but the word pizza is Greek in origin,
                    derived
                    from the Greek word pēktos meaning solid or clotted. The ancient Greeks covered their bread with
                    oils, herbs
                    and cheese. The first major innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a
                    topping. It
                    was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and
                    so the
                    pizza began.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    While it is difficult to say for sure who invented the pizza, it is however believed that modern
                    pizza was
                    first made by baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In fact, a popular urban legend holds that the
                    archetypal
                    pizza, Pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the
                    Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita.
                    Of the
                    three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the
                    Italian
                    flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then
                    named
                    after the Queen as Pizza Margherita.

                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <p class="discription">
                    Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some
                    kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array
                    of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits.
                    The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other
                    sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion.
                    Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called "batter"[8]) as thin as
                    possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to better form. In the
                    cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of
                    butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much
                    higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser
                    after removal from the oven.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Oils in baked cakes do not behave as baking soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than
                    evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from
                    what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by
                    heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the
                    cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not
                    sink into it.
